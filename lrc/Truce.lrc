[00:07.54] Now the night is coming to an end
[00:23.45] The sun will rise and we will try again
[00:39.67] Stay alive, stay alive for me
[00:45.23] 
[00:47.67] You will die, but now your life is free
[00:52.74] Take pride in what is sure to die
[01:01.11] 
[01:03.87] I will fear the night again
[01:19.28] I hope I'm not my only friend
[01:35.48] Stay alive, stay alive for me
[01:40.66] 
[01:43.53] You will die, but now your life is free
[01:48.73] Take pride in what is sure to die
[01:56.38]
